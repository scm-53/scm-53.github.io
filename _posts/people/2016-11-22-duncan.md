- Research: Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool in the investigation of the properties of molecules and solids. However, it is limited to the ground state of said systems. The related Time-Dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) goes beyond this limitation whilst still providing the ‘3N’ scaling of DFT. It is used to study the excited states of both molecules and solids, linking intuitively to spectroscopic methods.
Currently, I use this method to study the low lying states of fluorescent probe molecules used in lipid bilayer imaging. This informs on the non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics of such molecules and how they change in different solvents, in effect describing solvatochromism. I aim to move on to using this method to study core-level excited states of metallo-organic compounds, with consideration for the many-body effects or strong correlation present.
