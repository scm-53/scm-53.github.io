 - Research: it is well known that Quantum Monte Carlo simulations are plagued
 with numerical and statistical errors. The goal of my current research is to
 try and minimise some of these errors so that that Dynamincal Mean Field
 Theory (DMFT) calculations (i) become more accurate and (ii) converge faster.
 To that end,  I am developing impurity solvers for the Dynamical Mean Field Theory.
 With a broader view in mind, I am aiming to use these solvers to investigate
 the equation of state for strongly correlated systems.
